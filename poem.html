<h1>When I Grow Up</h1>

<p>Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be? <br>
Take a seat, let me tell you my <em>ridiculous dreams</em>. <strong>I wanna rap</strong>, yeah, I know it's hard to believe.<br>
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed, but I'm okay with it. I admit the lyrics are weak I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet.&nbsp;
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic</p>
<p>And honestly, I might not ever make a difference</p>
<ul>
    <li>But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it</li>
    <li>I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician</li>
    <li>To see the odds ain't rootin' for me</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be</p>
<ol>
    <li>'Cause when you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose</li>
    <li>And when you got nothin', you got nothin' to prove</li>
    <li>So when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?</li>
</ol>
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal
